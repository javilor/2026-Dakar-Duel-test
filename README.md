### 2. Stage Scoring (Position-Based)

For each stage, for each active competitor, points are awarded based on actual stage position:

| Stage Position           | Points |
|--------------------------|--------|
| 1st                      | 100    |
| 2nd                      | 90     |
| 3rd                      | 80     |
| 4th                      | 70     |
| 5th                      | 60     |
| 6th                      | 50     |
| 7th                      | 40     |
| 8th                      | 30     |
| 9th                      | 20     |
| 10th                     | 10     |
| 11th or lower / DNF / DNS | 0     |

**Note**: Same scoring table applies to Moto and Cars. Only official stage classifications are used.

---

### 3. Replacement Rule (First Abandonment)

If one of your active competitors in a category abandons the rally (withdrawal, permanent DNS):
- Your pre-selected replacement for that category becomes active.
- Activation starts from the next stage.
- The replacement then scores normally for the rest of the game.
- Only one replacement per category is allowed.

---

### 4. Captain Rule (Low-Risk, Every Stage)

Before each stage, each player may nominate one Captain, chosen from:
- Either Moto or Cars
- Must be one of your currently active competitors

**Captain Bonus**:
- If the Captain finishes inside the top 10 on that stage → +20 points
- If the Captain finishes outside the top 10 or DNFs → 0 bonus

**Rules**:
- Only one Captain per stage.
- Captain bonus stacks on top of normal stage points.
- Captain has no penalty.

**Purpose**:
- Adds daily engagement.
- Rewards confidence without overwhelming the scoring.

---

### 5. Joker Rule (One-Time High-Impact Play)

Each player has one Joker for the entire 10-stage game.

**How to use the Joker**:
- Declare before a stage.
- Choose one active competitor (Moto or Car).
- That competitor becomes a Joker Rider/Driver for that stage only.

**Joker Effect**:
- If the Joker competitor finishes inside the top 10:
  - They score as if they finished two positions higher.
- If the Joker competitor wins the stage:
  - They score 120 points.
- If the Joker competitor finishes outside the top 10 or DNFs:
  - They score 0 points.

**Restrictions**:
- Joker can be used once total.
- Joker cannot be applied to a replacement on the same stage it is activated.

**Shared Joker Neutralization**:
- If both players Joker the same competitor in the same category on the same stage:
  - Joker effect is cancelled.
  - Both players score normal stage points.
  - Both Jokers are still consumed.

---

### 6. Emergency Pick Rule (Second Abandonment)

If, after using your replacement, a second active competitor abandons in the same category:
- **Emergency Pick Activation**: You may select one additional competitor from that category.
- The Emergency Pick becomes active starting the next stage.

**Emergency Penalty**:
- Immediately upon activation, you suffer a –100 point penalty (applied once, not per stage).

**Emergency Pick Restrictions**:
- Scores normally from activation onward.
- Cannot be Captain.
- Cannot receive Joker.
- Cannot receive final podium bonuses.
- Only one Emergency Pick per category is allowed.

**Purpose**:
- Prevents automatic loss due to extreme bad luck.
- The –100 penalty ensures this is a survival tool, not an advantage.

---

### 7. Final Podium Bonus (After Stage 10)

After Stage 10, bonuses are awarded based on overall classification at that point.

For each of your competitors (including replacements, but excluding Emergency Picks):

| Overall Position | Bonus |
|------------------|-------|
| 1st Overall      | 250   |
| 2nd Overall      | 150   |
| 3rd Overall      | 100   |

**Note**: Applies separately for Moto and Cars. A competitor can only receive one podium bonus.

---

### 8. Winning the Game

**Total Score =**  
- All stage points  
- Captain bonuses  
- Joker effects  
- Final podium bonuses  
- Emergency penalties (if any)  

The player with the highest total score wins.

**Tie-breakers**:
- Most stage wins (Moto + Cars combined).
- Best overall Moto finisher after Stage 10.
- Best overall Car finisher after Stage 10.

---

### 9. Design Intent (Why This Works)

- 0 points below 10th creates real Dakar volatility.
- Captain adds light, repeatable strategy.
- Joker is a single, memorable swing moment.
- Replacement + Emergency Pick protect against bad luck without removing consequences.
- Arithmetic remains trivial and transparent.
